This my solution for Exercises 6-13 for Strings, Numbers, and Console of the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# EXERCISES: Loops, Expressions, and Control

## EXERCISE 6

### Description
Use a do-while loop to output "Hello, World!" in a loop. Each time you output "Hello, World!" ask the user whether they would like to continue.

Hello, World!

Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Hello, World!
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```


## EXERCISE 7

## EXERCISE 8

Make exercises 2-5 run in a loop. Use a do-while loop to run the code in a loop. Each time you run the code ask the user whether they would like to continue.
 

## EXERCISE 9

### Description
Prompt the user to enter a language.  Based on the language the user input, display "Hello, World!" in that language.  Use a switch statement to choose what to display.

### Example

Determine whether the user is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Prompt the user to enter her height in inches.  If she is less than 54 inches tall, notify her that she cannot ride the Raptor. If she is at least 54 inches tall, notify her that she can ride the Raptor.

### Example
  
```
Enter your height in inches: 52.3
Sorry, you cannot ride the Raptor. You need 1.7 more inches.

Enter your height in inches: 55.9
Great, you can ride the Raptor!
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n

## EXERCISE 11

Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```

## EXERCISE 12

### Description
Output all the numbers from 9 to 0. Use a for loop to output all the numbers from 9 to 0.

9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```

## EXERCISE 13
### Description
Prompt the user for a number. Use a for loop to output all the numbers from that number to 0.

5 4 3 2 1 0
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number: 12
12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
